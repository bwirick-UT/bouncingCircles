# Concept
This code is a simulation of circles that have a gravity effect as well as collision effects with other circles and the surrounding 'walls' or edges of the screen.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)
The app is accessible on mobile to utilize the mobile device's gyroscope with orientations allowing the user to rotate the phone and the circls will fall to the bottom of the orientation.

### PSA for iOS
If the user is on an iOS device, permissions are needed to access the phones orientation data. The button is located at the bottom left corner of the page. Click that button, grant access and now the app will work as intended.
